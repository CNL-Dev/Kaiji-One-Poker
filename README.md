# Kaiji-One-Poker

This is an attempt at a unity game that is based on the "One Poker" game in the manga Tobaku Datenroku Kaiji: One Poker-hen. This game is a variant of poker where two players will only have 2 cards in their posession at a time, and can only play and draw 1 card. A 8-King (known as upcards) will beat a down card (1-7), with the exception of an Ace beating a King. Color and Suit does not matter for this game. If both cards played are upcards or downcards, the card with a higher rank will win. If both cards are the same rank, the round ends in a tie. More details will be added to this readme as development continues.
