# Kaiji-One-Poker

This is an attempt at a unity game that is based on the "One Poker" game in the manga Tobaku Datenroku Kaiji: One Poker-hen. This game is a variant of poker where two players will only have 2 cards in their posession at a time, and can only play and draw 1 card. A 8-Ace (known as upcards) will beat a down card (2-7), an Ace will beat a King. A 2 will beat an Ace. Color and Suit does not matter for this game. If both cards played are upcards or downcards, the card with a higher rank will win. If both cards are the same rank, the round ends in a tie. More details will be added to this readme as development continues. 

# Indefinite Hiatus

If you've been paying attention to Unity lately, then you should be aware of the recent changes to Unity's policies. If not, in summary they will begin charging developers for each installation of their product once a certain financial threshold has been met. This policy will also apply to pre-existing Unity projects. Unity has yet to provide concrete details on how exactly they will enforce this new policy, which makes the volatility of gamedev even worse. While this won't personally affect my projects, I'm afraid that I do not feel comfortable using a product by Unity with their track record of mishaps over the past few years. I will likely switch over to a new game engine for future projects, or even create my own if I am feeling adventurous. As for now, I have other projects to focus on. 

# To Do
